# Stock market system for DarkRP
A stock market system modification for Garry's Mod written in 2017, the code is very old and outdated but should still be functional. Feel free to use and modify the code as you wish but remember to give credit. Used to fetch stocks from Yahoo API when it was available, now it only supports "fake" stocks.

It used to be sold on gmodstore and you can view more details [here](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/4058)

Requires version 2.5.0+ version of DarkRP and CSS content to be installed

**NOTE: This addon is not allowed to be used for commercial use.**
